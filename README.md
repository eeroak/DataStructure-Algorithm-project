## Usage
With this project, you can test some of the most essential and basic data structures in python,  
and how they work. I have tried to comment everything as well as possible, so anyone can understand the concepts.

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
    <li> My greatest challenge throughout this process was fully grasping the concepts involved. Understanding everything thoroughly was my goal, as I recognize the importance of this topic and skill for the future. </li>
    <li>Regarding coding, most aspects of basic data structures were relatively clear to me, except for linked-list implementation. Initially, I struggled to comprehend how they function and found coding them to be difficult.</li>
    <li>I found fundamental algorithms more engaging, but sorting algorithms presented the toughest challenge in terms of both understanding and coding. To overcome this hurdle, I relied heavily on visualizations and tutorials to deepen my understanding and effectively tackle the coding aspect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When comparing different search, tree-traversal, and sorting algorithms, I discovered significant variations in their speeds. Surprisingly, making small changes and adding just a few lines of code can greatly impact their performance.</li>
    <li>For instance, in sorting algorithms, my implementation of merge sort proved to be over 2000 times faster than bubble sort when sorting the same amount of random data. To put it into perspective, while bubble sort would take nearly 8 hours (according to my calculations) to sort 1 million random data points, merge sort achieved it in just 1.7 seconds.
    </li>
    <li>Tree-traversal algorithms showed minimal differences, even with large random binary trees. However, binary search outperformed the other search algorithms I tested by a significant margin.</li>
