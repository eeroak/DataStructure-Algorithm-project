# DataStructure-Algorithm-project
## Implementation of Essential Data Structures and Algorithms in Python


#### Project Objectives:

1. Implement basic data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues as well as trees (binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees) and hash tables in Python.  

2. Implement fundamental algorithms such as sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort), searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search), and tree traversal algorithms (e.g., in-order traversal, pre-order traversal, post-order traversal) in Python.  

3. Analyze the time complexity and space complexity of implemented algorithms, focusing on their efficiency and performance characteristics.  

4. Develop test cases to validate the correctness and effectiveness of implemented data structures and algorithms, covering various scenarios and edge cases.  

5. Compare the performance of different sorting algorithms and tree traversal algorithms in Python, evaluating their suitability for different input sizes and types.  

6. Explore and implement basic hash functions and collision resolution techniques in hash tables using Python.
